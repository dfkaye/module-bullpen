An example repo that uses <a href='//rawgithub.com/'>rawgithub</a> for testing pages in a browser.  This one uses a 
fake js experiment pretending to test a module/require solution.

Using [github](https://github.com) to create and edit files remotely on the github site lets you prototype ideas 
fairly fast.
Using [rawgithub](https://rawgithub.com) lets you view __and share__ a remote repo example html without downloading the whole repo in order
to run it locally.
Once you're happy enough with the direction, you can then init the repo and pull it to your local dev environment.
