Using [github](https://github.com) to create and edit files remotely on the github site lets you prototype ideas extremely fast.
Using [rawgithub](https://rawgithub.com) lets you view __and share__ a remote repo example html without downloading the whole repo in order
to run it locally.
Once you're happy enough with the direction, you can then init the repo and pull it to your local dev environment.
