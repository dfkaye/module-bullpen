An example repo that uses <a href='//rawgit.com/'>rawgit</a> for testing 
pages in a browser.  This one uses a fake js experiment pretending to test a 
module/require solution.

Using [github](https://github.com) to create and edit files remotely on the 
github site lets you prototype ideas fairly fast.

Using [rawgit](https://rawgit.com) lets you view __and share__ a remote 
repo example html without downloading the whole repo in order to run it locally.

Once you're happy enough with the direction, you can then init the repo and pull 
it to your local dev environment. Here's a cheat sheet for a 
[github-gitbash-workflow](https://gist.github.com/dfkaye/6768719).
